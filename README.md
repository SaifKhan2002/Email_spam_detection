# Email Spam Detection Using Python

This repository contains a **Spam Detection** model built in **Python** that classifies email messages as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam". It utilizes **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** techniques to preprocess text data, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance using a real-world dataset combined with synthetic data.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline for spam email detection, from data preprocessing and model training to hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes text normalization, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Built using scikit-learn's `Pipeline`, leveraging **TF-IDF** for text vectorization and **Multinomial Naive Bayes** for classification.
- **Model Optimization**: Uses **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation.
- **Prediction Function**: Classify new email messages as either 'spam' or 'ham'.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides a confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report for model evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the machine learning pipeline, model training, and evaluation.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For data visualization (e.g., confusion matrix plotting).
- **Faker**: For generating fake text data for training and testing purposes.

## üì• Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can install them via `pip`.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

#Generating Predictions
message = "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card!"
prediction = predict_message(message)
print(f"The message is classified as: {prediction}")
def predict_message(message):
    # Preprocess the message
    processed_message = preprocess(message)
    
    # Predict using the trained model
    prediction = grid_search.best_estimator_.predict([processed_message])
    
    return 'ham' if prediction == 0 else 'spam'

# Example usage
message = "Win big money now!"
result = predict_message(message)
print(f"Predicted Label: {result}")


#bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Email_spam_detection_using_python.git

python spam_detection.py


Let me know if anything is missing or incorrect it actually generate and detect a spam email through dataset....
